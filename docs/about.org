I am tied to the idea "Small is Beautiful" and does farming in my native
village over the weekends.  I attribute most of the problems that afflict us
today to bigness.  I am also of the firm belief that bigness takes away the
connection between man and nature and allows one to sheild from owning
responsiblity for the irreparable damage being done to EARTH.
